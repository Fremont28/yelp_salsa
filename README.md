What’s the Deal with La Salsa? 
	
La Salsa is a Los Angeles based restaurant serving Tex-Mex fast food. Yelp reviewers have mixed reactions to La Salsa’s food and service. Some describe the food (particularly burritos) as a “delicious surprise.” Others describe the food as “very mediocre” and “cold food and bad service.” 

In the interest of sentiment analysis, we scraped 57 user reviews from a La Salsa restaurant located on Pico Boulevard, Los Angeles (90064 zip code). This particular La Salsa location receives a serviceable 3.5 stars, which is better than most Taco Bell locations. As an aside, Taco Bell was also originally founded in the Los Angeles region (Irvine, California).
